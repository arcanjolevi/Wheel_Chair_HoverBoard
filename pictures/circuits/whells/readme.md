# This is the wheel form hoverBoard:

 * There should be two of them, but you can use only one if wish.
 
 * Just connect them to the mainBoard by:
 
   * Connect the hall sensor(Don't worry, it will only fit in if it is the right cable).
   * Connect the respectives cables to the board(Green->Green, Yellow->Yellow, Blue->Blue).
